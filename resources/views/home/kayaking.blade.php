<h1>Kayaking</h1>

<p>Looking to be closer to the water but not in it? Try kayaking! Kayaks are easier to paddle for those going on their first water trip. Kayaks are easier to maneuver. We offer kayaks for one or two riders. Single rider kayaks are available in two styles: sit on top or sit inside.</p>
