<p>Open the windows at night and fall asleep to the sound of the babbling river, while resting comfortably on a real bed. Camping cabins are now available for those who want to experience the beauty of the outdoors while&nbsp;enjoying some of the creature comforts of home. &nbsp;Our Amish-built cabins feature a cozy porch with seating, full-size bunk beds, futon couches, ceiling fans, table and chairs to seat 4, mini fridge and microwave. Cabins also enjoy access to their own fire pit, picnic table, and outdoor water spigot. Campsites are available adjacent to the cabins for party members that are looking for a more traditional camping experience.</p>
